# The Legend of Aurum Draconis

**A blockchain RPG (Play-to-Earn) built on the Avalanche network.**

## 🚀 Overview  
The Legend of Aurum Draconis is a fantasy role-playing game (RPG) by Dragon Crypto Gaming. Players recruit Hero NFTs, craft gear, battle enemies, explore the world of Dragon Haven, and earn or trade NFT items. The game leverages the Avalanche blockchain to allow true ownership of characters and assets.

## 🎮 Key Features  
- Hero NFTs – unique characters with skills, levels, and customisation.  
- Loot & Crafting – equipment (Common → Legendary), crafting blueprints, item repair.  
- Token Economics – utilises DCAU and DCAR tokens within the game economy.  
- Marketplace & Trading – trade your NFTs, gear and resources.  
- Blockchain Infrastructure – built on Avalanche for faster and lower-cost interactions.  
- Ownership & Economy – players own assets; game mechanics designed to be sustainable.

## 📚 Tokens & Economy  
- **DCAU** (Dragon Crypto Aurum) – utility token used for purchasing Hero NFTs, in-game actions like battling & healing. Fully minted, community-owned. :contentReference[oaicite:15]{index=15}  
- **DCAR** (Dragon Crypto Argenti) – drives crafting, land-ownership and higher tier mechanics for the DCG ecosystem. :contentReference[oaicite:16]{index=16}  
- Token supply: ~154 k total supply of DCAU; ~151.7 k circulating (as of recent data). :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}

6. Track tokens & economies: DCAU and DCAR usage within the game.  

## 📅 Roadmap & Vision  
As part of the broader DCG universe, The Legend of Aurum Draconis is the first full-release game. Future phases include expanded crafting, land ownership, PvP arenas, Tiny Dragons integration, further tokens and network expansion. :contentReference[oaicite:19]{index=19}

## ✅ Why This Project Is Compelling  
- Merges nostalgic RPG gameplay with blockchain ownership & GameFi rewards.  
- Lower barrier to entry (Avalanche fees are relatively low) compared to some other chains.  
- Real ownership of NFTs and in-game assets, letting players trade and craft in a player-driven economy.  
- Unique token-economics design with limited supply utility token (DCAU) for game actions.

## ⚠️ Things to Watch  
- The success of game-fi depends on active players, updates, and ecosystem health.  
- Ensure you understand NFT ownership rights (licensing) and token utility within the game.  
- As with all crypto/gaming projects, there are market risks, regulatory uncertainties and technological risks (smart contracts, game bugs, tokenomics sustainability).  
- Small supply token → liquidity risk may be higher.
